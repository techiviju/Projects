Developed a secure, full-stack Notes Management Application utilizing Java Spring Boot to build robust RESTful APIs and React.js with Tailwind CSS for a responsive user interface. The system features JWT authentication with role-based access (Admin/User), secure data handling via BCrypt encryption, and persistent storage managed by MySQL and JPA/Hibernate. This project demonstrates expertise across the entire development lifecycle, from designing efficient backend services and CRUD operations to creating dynamic frontend experiences and preparing for deployment using Maven and Docker.<img width="1365" height="628" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-17 14-41-26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a608c05c-e9eb-4ae0-bb28-4849a74cd42c" />
